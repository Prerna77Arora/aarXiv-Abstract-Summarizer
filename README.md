# aarXiv-Abstract-Summarizer
Welcome to our AI-powered research paper summarization tool!
Get concise and informative summaries of research papers with just a few clicks using this notebook. Designed to save you time and effort, it accurately summarizes content-heavy research abstracts and highlights key findings.

Say goodbye to lengthy reading—and hello to efficient research!
# 🚀 **Getting Started**
Getting started is simple. This notebook automatically:

Fetches the latest AI-related research papers from arXiv.

Uses natural language processing (NLP) to summarize each abstract.

Returns clear and short summaries using the facebook/bart-large-cnn model from HuggingFace.

This tool is perfect for students, researchers, or professionals looking to quickly grasp the essence of recent publications.

# ✨ **Features**

✅ Summarizes latest abstracts from arXiv.org
✅ Uses HuggingFace Transformers for summarization
✅ Retrieves papers by topic (default: AI/ML)
✅ Easy-to-use and customizable
✅ Outputs are displayed in tabular format with publication dates and categories

# 📂 **Clone the Repository**

git clone https://github.com/your-username/ResearchPaperSummarizer.git

cd ResearchPaperSummarizer

**Note**: This project runs best in a Jupyter or Google Colab environment.


# Install the required Python packages:

pip install transformers

pip install arxiv

pip install pandas

##📓 How to Use

Option 1: Run on Google Colab

Click here to open the notebook directly:
🔗 ResearchPaperSummarizer.ipynb

Option 2: Run locally
from transformers import pipeline
import arxiv
import pandas as pd

# Search for recent AI-related papers
query = 'ai OR artificial intelligence OR machine learning'
search = arxiv.Search(query=query, max_results=10, sort_by=arxiv.SortCriterion.SubmittedDate)

# Collect abstracts and titles
papers = []
for result in search.results():
    papers.append({
        'published': result.published,
        'title': result.title,
        'abstract': result.summary,
        'categories': result.categories
    })

# Create DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(papers)

# Summarize the first abstract
abstract = df['abstract'][0]
summarizer = pipeline("summarization", model="facebook/bart-large-cnn")
summary = summarizer(abstract)[0]['summary_text']
print("Summary:", summary)

# 📌 Example Output
Title: "A Transformer-Based Approach to General Intelligence"
Published: 2025-06-01
Summary: This paper presents a novel architecture based on transformer models to improve reasoning and generalization in artificial intelligence systems...

# ⚠️ Limitations
While our tool provides efficient summarizations, it is not a replacement for reading the full paper. Use the output as a quick overview of the paper’s main ideas, not as a substitute for deep reading.

# 🤝 Contributing
Contributions are welcome!
